# cse210-student-template
This is the starter code for students in CSE 210.

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

Isaac Bullinger
* `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
* `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
* `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
* `final` - Starter projects for final project.

This is a showcase of different object oriented small projects made in C#.

If you go to `final` > `FinalProject` you will find an ascii game of battleship that I made.
